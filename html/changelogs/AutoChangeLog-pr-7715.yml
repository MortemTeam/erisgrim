changes:
  - code_imp: get_process_efficiency(), organ process is only searched once
  - code_imp: handle_blood(), OP_VESSEL is searched after we know the organ has a
      blood requirement
  - code_imp: Dead organs are removed from processing list
  - code_imp: Organ stasis is only checked if there is no owner
  - code_imp: Organ bleeding no longer checks if there is blood because remove_reagents()
      already does so
